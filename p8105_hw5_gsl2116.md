Problem 1
---------

``` r
participant_data %>% 
  group_by(arm, study_id) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observation, type = study_id, color = arm)) + 
    geom_line() +
  theme_minimal() +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
    labs(x = "Week", y = "Observations", 
         title = "Observations for each subject, by week and study arm")
```

The figure above details the observations of 20 study participants over eight weeks. Half the participants were assigned to the control arm, and the other half were assigned to the experimental arm. Early in the study, there was not much difference between the two study arms. However, as the weeks passed, the observations in the experimental arm continued to increase even as no appreciable change was seen in the control arm.
